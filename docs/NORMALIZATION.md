# Database Normalization Documentation
## Online Course Registration System

---

## Overview

This document demonstrates how the database schema achieves Third Normal Form (3NF) and ensures data integrity through proper normalization.

---

## Normalization Process

### Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)

**Definition:** A relation is in 1NF if:
- All attributes contain only atomic (indivisible) values
- Each column contains values of a single type
- Each column has a unique name
- The order of rows doesn't matter

#### Analysis of Tables

✅ **All tables satisfy 1NF:**

**STUDENTS Table:**
- Each field contains atomic values (no arrays or lists)
- `name` is split into `first_name` and `last_name` (atomic)
- Each attribute has a single data type
- No repeating groups

**COURSES Table:**
- All attributes are atomic
- `course_code`, `course_name`, `description` are single values
- No multi-valued dependencies

**ENROLLMENTS Table:**
- All attributes are atomic
- Single student, single offering per row
- No composite attributes

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Example: Student table in 1NF
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT,              -- Atomic
    first_name VARCHAR(50),      -- Atomic (not full_name)
    last_name VARCHAR(50),       -- Atomic
    email VARCHAR(100),          -- Atomic
    phone VARCHAR(20),           -- Atomic
    date_of_birth DATE,          -- Atomic
    -- No arrays, no repeating groups
);
```

---

### Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Definition:** A relation is in 2NF if:
- It is in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
- No partial dependencies (relevant for composite keys)

#### Analysis

✅ **All tables satisfy 2NF:**

**Tables with Simple Primary Keys:**
- `students(student_id)` - All attributes depend on student_id
- `courses(course_id)` - All attributes depend on course_id
- `instructors(instructor_id)` - All attributes depend on instructor_id
- `departments(department_id)` - All attributes depend on department_id

**Composite Key Verification:**

**ENROLLMENTS Table:**
- Natural key would be (student_id, offering_id)
- We use a surrogate key `enrollment_id` as primary key
- All non-key attributes (enrollment_date, status, grade) depend on the entire key
- No partial dependencies

**Example of 2NF Compliance:**
```sql
-- ENROLLMENT is in 2NF
-- enrollment_date depends on (student_id, offering_id) together
-- grade depends on (student_id, offering_id) together
-- No attribute depends on just student_id or just offering_id alone

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Surrogate key
    student_id INT,                       -- Part of natural key
    offering_id INT,                      -- Part of natural key
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP,            -- Depends on full key
    status ENUM(...),                     -- Depends on full key
    grade VARCHAR(2),                     -- Depends on full key
    UNIQUE(student_id, offering_id)      -- Natural key constraint
);
```

**Preventing Partial Dependencies:**

If we had a table like this (BAD DESIGN):
```sql
-- WRONG: Violates 2NF
CREATE TABLE bad_enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    offering_id INT,
    student_name VARCHAR(100),     -- ❌ Depends only on student_id
    course_name VARCHAR(100),      -- ❌ Depends only on offering_id
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, offering_id)
);
```

Our solution (GOOD DESIGN):
```sql
-- CORRECT: Separate tables, no partial dependencies
-- Students table has student attributes
-- Course_offerings has course attributes
-- Enrollments only has enrollment attributes
```

---

### Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Definition:** A relation is in 3NF if:
- It is in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes don't depend on other non-key attributes)

#### Analysis and Decomposition

✅ **All tables satisfy 3NF:**

**1. STUDENTS Table**

Before normalization (hypothetical bad design):
```sql
-- WRONG: Violates 3NF
CREATE TABLE students_bad (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),    -- ❌ Transitive dependency
    department_building VARCHAR(50), -- ❌ Depends on department_name
    -- Transitive: student_id → department_id → department_name
);
```

After normalization (our design):
```sql
-- CORRECT: 3NF compliant
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,              -- Foreign key only
    -- No department attributes stored here
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_code VARCHAR(10),
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    building VARCHAR(50),
    -- Department attributes in separate table
);
```

**Reasoning:**
- `department_name` depends on `department_id`, not directly on `student_id`
- This is a transitive dependency: `student_id → department_id → department_name`
- Solution: Create separate DEPARTMENTS table

---

**2. COURSES Table**

Our design:
```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_code VARCHAR(20),
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    credits INT,
    department_id INT,              -- Foreign key
    prerequisite_course_id INT,     -- Foreign key
);
```

**3NF Verification:**
- ✅ `course_name` depends directly on `course_id`
- ✅ `credits` depends directly on `course_id`
- ✅ `department_id` is just a foreign key (reference)
- ✅ No department details stored in courses table
- ✅ No transitive dependencies

---

**3. COURSE_OFFERINGS Table**

Before normalization (hypothetical):
```sql
-- WRONG: Violates 3NF
CREATE TABLE offerings_bad (
    offering_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INT,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),        -- ❌ Depends on course_id
    instructor_id INT,
    instructor_name VARCHAR(100),    -- ❌ Depends on instructor_id
    semester_id INT,
    semester_name VARCHAR(50),       -- ❌ Depends on semester_id
);
```

After normalization (our design):
```sql
-- CORRECT: 3NF compliant
CREATE TABLE course_offerings (
    offering_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INT,                   -- Foreign key
    semester_id INT,                 -- Foreign key
    instructor_id INT,               -- Foreign key
    section_number VARCHAR(10),
    max_capacity INT,
    enrolled_count INT,
    schedule_days VARCHAR(20),
    schedule_time VARCHAR(50),
    classroom VARCHAR(50),
);

-- Related data in separate tables
CREATE TABLE courses (...);
CREATE TABLE instructors (...);
CREATE TABLE semesters (...);
```

**Reasoning:**
- Instructor name depends on instructor_id, not offering_id
- Course name depends on course_id, not offering_id
- Semester name depends on semester_id, not offering_id
- These are transitive dependencies, resolved by separate tables

---

**4. ENROLLMENTS Table**

Our design:
```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    offering_id INT,
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('ENROLLED', 'DROPPED', 'COMPLETED', 'WITHDRAWN'),
    grade VARCHAR(2),
    grade_points DECIMAL(3,2),
    attendance_percentage DECIMAL(5,2)
);
```

**3NF Verification:**
- ✅ All attributes depend directly on enrollment_id
- ✅ `grade_points` could be calculated from `grade`, but we store it for performance
- ✅ No student details (name, email) stored here
- ✅ No course details (name, credits) stored here
- ✅ No transitive dependencies

---

## Functional Dependencies

```

### ENROLLMENTS Table
```
Functional Dependencies:
enrollment_id → student_id
enrollment_id → offering_id
enrollment_id → enrollment_date
enrollment_id → status

Alternate Key: (student_id, offering_id)
All attributes depend on full key
No partial or transitive dependencies
```

## Benefits of Normalization in Our System

### 1. Eliminated Data Redundancy

**Before (unnormalized):**
- Student department name repeated for every student
- Course name repeated for every offering
- Instructor details repeated for every course they teach

**After (normalized):**
- Department stored once, referenced by ID
- Course details stored once, referenced by offerings
- Instructor details stored once, referenced by multiple offerings

**Storage Savings:**
```
Unnormalized: 1000 students × 50 bytes (dept_name) = 50KB redundant
Normalized: 8 departments × 50 bytes = 400 bytes + 1000 × 4 bytes (FK) = 4.4KB
Savings: ~45KB per 1000 students (90% reduction)
```

### 2. Eliminated Update Anomalies

**Scenario:** Change department name

**Unnormalized:**
```sql
-- Must update in multiple places, risk of inconsistency
UPDATE students SET department_name = 'New Name' WHERE department_id = 1;
UPDATE courses SET department_name = 'New Name' WHERE department_id = 1;
UPDATE instructors SET department_name = 'New Name' WHERE department_id = 1;
-- If we miss one, data becomes inconsistent!
```

**Normalized:**
```sql
-- Single point of update
UPDATE departments SET department_name = 'New Name' WHERE department_id = 1;
-- All references automatically see the new name
```

### 3. Eliminated Insertion Anomalies

**Scenario:** Add new department

**Unnormalized:**
```sql
-- Can't add department without having a student/course in it
-- Leads to NULL values or dummy records
```

**Normalized:**
```sql
-- Can add department independently
INSERT INTO departments (department_code, department_name, building)
VALUES ('BIO', 'Biology', 'Science Building');
-- Add courses/students later
```

### 4. Eliminated Deletion Anomalies

**Scenario:** Last student graduates from a department

**Unnormalized:**
```sql
-- Deleting the student also loses department information
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 123;
-- Department information is lost if no other students!
```

**Normalized:**
```sql
-- Department information preserved
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 123;
-- Department still exists in departments table
```

### 5. Improved Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Can't have orphaned enrollments (student/offering must exist)
- Can't delete course that has active offerings (CASCADE rules)
- Consistent data across the system

### 6. Query Performance

While normalization can require joins, we've optimized with:
- **Indexes** on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- **Views** for common complex queries
- **Denormalization** where justified (enrolled_count for performance)

---

## Denormalization Decisions

### Calculated Field: enrolled_count

**Location:** `course_offerings.enrolled_count`

**Why Denormalized:**
```sql
-- Without denormalization (always calculate):
SELECT co.*, COUNT(e.enrollment_id) as enrolled_count
FROM course_offerings co
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON co.offering_id = e.offering_id 
WHERE e.status = 'ENROLLED'
GROUP BY co.offering_id;
-- Performance: O(n) for every query
```

**With denormalization (stored count):**
```sql
-- Fast lookup:
SELECT * FROM course_offerings WHERE offering_id = 123;
-- Performance: O(1) - direct lookup
```

**Maintenance:**
- Triggers automatically maintain accuracy
- Trade-off: Slightly slower inserts/updates for much faster reads
- Justified because enrollments are read more than written

### Views for Complex Queries

We use views (denormalization technique) for frequently accessed data:

```sql
CREATE VIEW course_offerings_detail AS
SELECT 
    co.*,
    c.course_code,
    c.course_name,
    sem.semester_name,
    i.first_name || ' ' || i.last_name AS instructor_name
FROM course_offerings co
JOIN courses c ON co.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN semesters sem ON co.semester_id = sem.semester_id
LEFT JOIN instructors i ON co.instructor_id = i.instructor_id;

-- Usage: Simple and fast
SELECT * FROM course_offerings_detail WHERE semester_name = 'Fall';
```
