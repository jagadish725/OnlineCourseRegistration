## 📊 Database Design

### Tables (9 Total)

1. **students** - Student accounts and information
2. **courses** - Course catalog
3. **instructors** - Faculty information
4. **departments** - Academic departments
5. **semesters** - Academic terms
6. **course_offerings** - Course sections per semester
7. **enrollments** - Student registrations
8. **admins** - Administrator accounts
9. **waitlist** - Course waitlist management

### Key Features
- ✅ Third Normal Form (3NF)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Triggers for automation
- ✅ Views for complex queries
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Check constraints for validation

---

## 🎓 DBMS Concepts Implemented

### 1. Normalization
- **1NF**: All attributes are atomic
- **2NF**: No partial dependencies
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies
- Result: Minimal redundancy, no anomalies

### 2. ER Modeling
- 9 entities with clear relationships
- 1:N and N:M relationships properly resolved
- Recursive relationship (course prerequisites)
- Weak and strong entities identified

### 3. SQL Operations

**DDL (Data Definition Language):**
- CREATE TABLE with constraints
- ALTER TABLE operations
- CREATE VIEW for complex queries
- CREATE INDEX for performance

**DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
- INSERT for adding data
- UPDATE for modifications
- DELETE with cascading
- Complex SELECT with joins

**DCL (Data Control Language):**
- GRANT/REVOKE permissions
- Role-based access control

**TCL (Transaction Control Language):**
- BEGIN TRANSACTION
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK for data integrity

### 4. Constraints
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identification
- **Foreign Keys**: Referential integrity
- **Unique Constraints**: No duplicates
- **Check Constraints**: Data validation
- **Not Null**: Required fields

### 5. Triggers
```sql
-- Auto-update enrollment counts
AFTER INSERT ON enrollments
AFTER UPDATE ON enrollments
BEFORE INSERT ON enrollments (capacity check)
```

### 6. Views
```sql
-- Simplified complex queries
student_enrollment_summary
course_offerings_detail
enrollment_details
```

### 7. Transactions
- ACID properties maintained
- Atomic enrollment operations
- Rollback on errors
- Consistent state guaranteed

### 8. Stored Procedures
- Can be extended for complex operations
- Encapsulate business logic
